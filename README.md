ASCII
=====

## Presentation

ASCII is a simple MMF1/MMF2/CF2.5 extension allowing to cast integer to character and vice versa.

## Alternatives

Several others extensions provide the same feature to Click-developer. One, for example, would be _String Parser 2_. If you are using/switching to this last extension you will probably need to use the following expression:

    (asc( "String Parser", > Character to cast <) and 255)

## Details

ASCII is currently developed using:
- MMF 2 standard SDK
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition
